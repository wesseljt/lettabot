# Cron Jobs

Schedule tasks that send messages to the agent at specified times. Jobs are scheduled immediately when created.

## Quick Reference

```bash
lettabot-cron list                    # List all jobs
lettabot-cron create [options]        # Create job
lettabot-cron delete ID               # Delete job
lettabot-cron enable ID               # Enable job
lettabot-cron disable ID              # Disable job
```

## Create a Job

```bash
lettabot-cron create \
  --name "Morning Briefing" \
  --schedule "0 8 * * *" \
  --message "Good morning! Review tasks for today." \
  --deliver telegram:123456789
```

**Options:**
- `-n, --name` - Job name (required)
- `-s, --schedule` - Cron expression (required)  
- `-m, --message` - Prompt sent to the agent when the job fires (required)
- `-d, --deliver` - Auto-deliver the agent's response to a channel (format: `channel:chatId`). Without this flag, the job runs in **silent mode** (see below).
- `--disabled` - Create in disabled state

## Silent Mode vs Delivery Mode

Cron jobs run in one of two modes:

- **Silent mode** (no `--deliver`): The agent receives the message and can act on it (e.g., update memory, run tools), but the response is NOT automatically sent to any chat. If the agent wants to send a message, it must explicitly use `lettabot-message send`.
- **Delivery mode** (`--deliver channel:chatId`): The agent's response is automatically delivered to the specified channel/chat after execution.

## Message Format

When a cron job runs, the agent receives a message like:

```
[cron:cron-123abc Morning Briefing] Good morning! Review tasks for today.
Current time: 1/27/2026, 8:00:00 AM (America/Los_Angeles)
```

This tells the agent:
- The message came from a cron job (not a user)
- The job ID and name
- The current time

## Cron Schedule Syntax

```
----------- minute (0-59)
| --------- hour (0-23)  
| | ------- day of month (1-31)
| | | ----- month (1-12)
| | | | --- day of week (0-6, Sun=0)
* * * * *
```

| Pattern | When |
|---------|------|
| `0 8 * * *` | Daily at 8:00 AM |
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 9:00 AM |
| `0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |
| `30 17 * * 5` | Fridays at 5:30 PM |
| `0 0 1 * *` | First of month at midnight |

## Examples

**Daily morning check-in (delivered to Telegram):**
```bash
lettabot-cron create \
  -n "Morning" \
  -s "0 8 * * *" \
  -m "Good morning! What's on today's agenda?" \
  -d telegram:123456789
```

**Weekly review (delivered to Slack):**
```bash
lettabot-cron create \
  -n "Weekly Review" \
  -s "0 17 * * 5" \
  -m "Friday wrap-up: What did we accomplish?" \
  -d slack:C1234567890
```

**Background task (silent mode - agent acts but no auto-delivery):**
```bash
lettabot-cron create \
  -n "Email Check" \
  -s "0 */2 * * *" \
  -m "Check for new emails and summarize anything important."
```

## Notes

- Jobs schedule immediately when created (no restart needed)
- Use `lettabot-cron list` to see next run times and last run status
- Jobs persist in `cron-jobs.json`
- Logs written to `cron-log.jsonl`
- Without `--deliver`, the agent must use `lettabot-message send` to communicate results to users
