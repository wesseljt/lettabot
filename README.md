#### Optional: Run a Letta Docker server 
You can use `lettabot` with a Docker server with: 
```

  -v ~/.letta/.persist/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 8283:8283 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" \

lettabot onboard
```

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lettabot onboard` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `lettabot server` | Start the bot server |
| `lettabot configure` | View and edit configuration |
| `lettabot skills status` | Show enabled and available skills |
| `lettabot destroy` | Delete all local data and start fresh |
| `lettabot help` | Show help |


## Channel Setup

LettaBot uses a **single agent with a single conversation** across all channels:

```
Telegram ──┐
Slack ─────┤
Discord ───┼──→ ONE AGENT ──→ ONE CONVERSATION
WhatsApp ──┤    (memory)      (chat history)
Signal ────┘
```

- Start a conversation on Telegram
- Continue it on Slack
- Pick it up on WhatsApp
- The agent remembers everything!

| Channel | Guide | Requirements |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Telegram | [Setup Guide](docs/getting-started.md) | Bot token from @BotFather |
| Slack | [Setup Guide](docs/slack-setup.md) | Slack app with Socket Mode |
| Discord | [Setup Guide](docs/discord-setup.md) | Discord bot + Message Content Intent |
| WhatsApp | [Setup Guide](docs/whatsapp-setup.md) | Phone with WhatsApp |
| Signal | [Setup Guide](docs/signal-setup.md) | signal-cli + phone number |

At least one channel is required. Telegram is the easiest to start with.

## Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Welcome message and help |
| `/status` | Show current session info |
| `/heartbeat` | Manually trigger a heartbeat check-in |

## Connect to Letta Code 
Any LettaBot agent can also be directly chatted with through [Letta Code](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-code). Use the `/status` command to find your `agent_id`, and run: 
```sh
letta --agent <agent_id>
```

## Security

### Network Architecture

**LettaBot uses outbound connections only** - no public URL or gateway required:

| Channel | Connection Type | Exposed Ports |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Telegram | Long-polling (outbound HTTP) | None |
| Slack | Socket Mode (outbound WebSocket) | None |
| Discord | Gateway (outbound WebSocket) | None |
| WhatsApp | Outbound WebSocket via Baileys | None |
| Signal | Local daemon on 127.0.0.1 | None |

### Tool Execution

By default, the agent is restricted to **read-only** operations:
- `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` - File exploration
- `web_search` - Internet queries
- `conversation_search` - Search past messages

### Access Control

LettaBot supports pairing-based access control. When `TELEGRAM_DM_POLICY=pairing`:
1. Unauthorized users get a pairing code
2. You approve codes via `lettabot pairing approve telegram <CODE>`
3. Approved users can then chat with the bot

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode (auto-reload)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
lettabot server
```

## Troubleshooting

### WhatsApp

**Session errors / "Bad MAC" messages**
These are normal Signal Protocol renegotiation messages. They're noisy but harmless.

**Messages going to wrong chat**
Clear the session and re-link:
```bash
rm -rf ./data/whatsapp-session
lettabot server  # Scan QR again
```

### Signal

**Port 8090 already in use**
```bash
SIGNAL_HTTP_PORT=8091
```

### General

**Agent not responding**
Delete the agent store to create a fresh agent:
```bash
lettabot destroy 
```
